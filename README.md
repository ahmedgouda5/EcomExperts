# Security System — E-Commerce Configurator

A React + TypeScript application for configuring and reviewing a home security system bundle. Users select cameras, sensors, and accessories through an accordion stepper, then review their selections in a checkout-ready summary.

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** + **TypeScript**
- **Vite** — build tooling
- **Zustand** — state management (per-category stores)
- **Tailwind CSS** — responsive utility-first styling
- **Lucide React** — icons
- **Radix UI** — accessible accordion primitives

## Design Principles

### Logic and UI are separated

Every feature follows the same pattern:

- **`services/`** — contains hooks (`useReviewData`) and pure functions (`renderProductRow`). All data fetching, computation, and store access lives here.
- **Component file** — contains only JSX layout. Imports from `services/` and delegates all logic.

This keeps components small, testable, and focused on presentation.

### Per-category Zustand stores

Instead of one monolithic store, each product category has its own Zustand store:

```ts
useCameraStore    → { products, toggleProduct, incrementQuantity, decrementQuantity, ... }
useSensorStore    → { products, toggleProduct, incrementQuantity, decrementQuantity, ... }
useAccessoryStore → { products, toggleProduct, incrementQuantity, decrementQuantity, ... }
```

All three stores share the same pure functions from `Store/service/productService.ts`:

```ts
toggleProduct(products, product)     → add or remove
incrementQuantity(products, id)      → quantity + 1
decrementQuantity(products, id)      → quantity - 1 (min 1)
getTotalPrice(products)              → sum of price × quantity
getOriginalPrice(products)           → sum of compareAtPrice × quantity
```

### Data separated by category

Product data lives in individual files (`data/cameras.ts`, `data/sensors.ts`, `data/accessories.ts`) rather than a single JSON blob. Each file exports a typed `Product[]` array. The barrel `data/index.ts` re-exports everything plus the step configuration.

### Store injection via props

`ProductCardUi` does not import any store directly. Instead, each section component (`CameraSection`, `SensorSection`, `AccessorySection`) passes its own store as a prop:

```tsx
// CameraSection.tsx
<ProductCardUi {...item} store={useCameraStore} />

// SensorSection.tsx
<ProductCardUi {...item} store={useSensorStore} />
```

This makes the card fully decoupled — it works with any category store.

### Responsive layout

- **Desktop (lg+):** Two-column layout — product list on the left, checkout summary sticky on the right (~380px).
- **Tablet & Mobile:** Single column — checkout summary moves below the product list.
- All spacing, padding, and typography scale with Tailwind breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`).

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server |
| `npm run build` | Type-check + production build |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |

## Deliverable

This repo contains:

- **React source code** — fully typed TypeScript, component-based architecture.
- **JSON data** — product data for cameras, sensors, and accessories in `src/data/`.
- **Run instructions** — clone the repo, then:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app builds and runs from a clean clone with no additional setup.

## Decisions & Tradeoffs

**What was built:**
- Accordion-based product configurator with 4 steps (cameras, plan, sensors, accessories).
- Per-category Zustand stores with shared pure service functions.
- Responsive two-column checkout review with live price calculations.
- Logic/UI separation — components are pure layout, services handle all data.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Product data is static (TypeScript files, not a backend API). A backend was not implemented.
- Auto-added sensor logic was removed during the final refactor in favor of simpler per-category stores. If cross-category bundling is needed later, the service layer can be extended.
- Variant selection (White/Black) is local UI state only — it does not affect the cart or pricing.
- The "Plan" and "Protection" accordion steps show placeholder content, not full product grids.
